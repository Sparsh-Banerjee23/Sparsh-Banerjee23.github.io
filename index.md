## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 6 Part 2 (Blackjack):

  This was my favorite lab because the entire concept and project was fun to code. Making a functioning blackjack game was a bit of a challenge, but while also being quite fun. By using if statements to      implement functions, the game came together to become a functional and fun blackjack game. It worked so well that I actually was able to play it with a friend.

* Lab 4 Part 2 (HiLo game):

  I also liked this lab, because it was an interesting challenge. Going into this class, I already had two years of prior experience in java, so this class is for the most part pretty simple for me. This     lab, while being easier for me than it was for others, was still a little complicated, and a nice change from the previous labs. Again, I was able to play this with someone else, my younger brother.

* Lab 7 Part 1 (Street parking)

  Out of these three labs that I have chosen, this lab took the longest to complete. It contained a multitude of if statements, both in the main, and in the functions, all coming together to create the       complicated parking schedule. Also, with all the streets having differing parking schedules really challenged me to think and implement the correct validity statements, as there were both different         times, as well as different dates.
